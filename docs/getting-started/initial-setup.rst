Initial Setup
=================================

Cabling IPMI
============

You will need to cable the RJ45 port above the 2 USB slots on the motherboard to cable IPMI initial setup text

Accessing IPMI
==============

From here, we'll need to configure an IPMI address. By default it pulls a DHCP address, otherwise we must enter the BIOS to configure IPMI statically

- DHCP
- Static IP

Using IPMI
==========

From here we can get general information, otherwise we can open up remote session with HTML5

This will allow us to do the initial network configuration and setup to access the dashboard.
